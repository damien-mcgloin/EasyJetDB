# EasyJetDB
This is a flight booking system reverse engineered from the easyjet website. This project was completed as part of the MSc in software development with Queen's University Belfast and for this I received a mark of 74.

With this project I had five chief concerns:

1. To demonstrate how someone would be able to book a flight with the possibility of selecting multiple seats and bag types.
2. The booker should be able to request special assistance and purchase items from the website's digital catalogue such as a meal voucher.
3. To reflect the website's ability to update as new flights, flight times, prices, and other information is updated.
4. To allow EasyJet staff the ability to find helpful information which would enable them to perform their job better.
5. To limit the possibility of inconsistent data i.e., data that is updated in one table but not in others.
